## It’s Hacktoberfest Time!

It’s the third day of October, we have enough time to submit a pull request and start contributing to open source community.<br> In general, I think it’s actually quite cool because it allows a lot of people from different backgrounds to join and work together. In my case, I got to know about this fest from a friend of mine. So I decided to give it a try...<br>
### Here’s what you need to do:<br>
• Register for Hacktoberfest<br>
• Find a project that interests you and jump in!<br>
• After you’ve done the work, submit a pull request.<br>
• Similarly, one has to submit 4 PR's
<br><br>
### All the best and Happy coding!!!
