Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community. It is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean.

Seven years ago, Hacktoberfest had kick-started the celebration along with 676 excited participants contributing to open source projects and earning a limited-edition T-shirt. Now, hundreds of thousands of developers participate in Hacktoberfest from 150 countries.

If you want to contribute to open-source projects, but don't know where to start, Then Hacktoberfest is the perfect opportunity for you.

If you complete 4prs valid, you get a T-shirt, some stickers, a cup coaster

The goal of the event is to encourage participation in the open-source community all across the globe. And the challenge is quite simple. Open four high-quality pull requests in October on any open source project to get some swags.
