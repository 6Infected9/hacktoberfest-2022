# Cross-platform mobile application development technologies

| Language or Technology  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)  |  React Native is an open-source UI software framework created by Facebook, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities.  |
| [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)  |  Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. First described in 2015, Flutter was released in May 2017.  |
| [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)  |  An open source mobile toolkit for building high quality, cross-platform native and web app experiences. Move faster with a single code base, running everywhere with JavaScript and the Web.  |
| [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org/)  |  NativeScript is an open-source framework to develop mobile apps on the Apple iOS and Android platforms.  Empower JavaScriptwith native APIs. Liberate your development by using platform APIs directly without leaving of JavaScript.  |
| [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)  |  Apache Cordova is a mobile application development framework created by Nitobi.  Cordova wraps your HTML/JavaScript app into a native container which can access the device functions of several platforms. These functions are exposed via a unified JavaScript API, allowing you to easily write one set of code to target nearly every phone or tablet on the market today and publish to their app stores.  |

# Frontend Frameworks

| Website | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|[Angular](https://angular.io/)	| AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community |
|[VueJs](https://v3.vuejs.org/) | VueJs is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications |
|[React](https://reactjs.org/) | ReactJS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components |
|[Ember](https://emberjs.com//) | Ember.js is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework for building modern web applications. It includes everything you need to build rich UIs that work on any device. |
|[Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/) | Backbone is a JavaScript framework based on MVC architecture for building single page applications |
|[Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) | Aurelia's standards-based, unobtrusive style makes it the only framework that empowers you to build components using vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript. If you know modern JS and HTML, there's little more to learn to build even the most complex apps. |
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)	| Svelte is a radical new approach to designing user interfaces. Whereas conventional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte transfers the work to a compile phase the happens when you create your app. Instead of using strategies such as virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes. |
|[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) | Preact offers the finest possible abstraction of Virtual DOM at the top of the DOM. Builds on stable platform functionality, registers real event handlers, and plays nicely with other libraries. Preact can be used directly in the browser without any transpiring steps. |
